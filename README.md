# Back End Week 13
## Description 

My motivation for this project was to build a api back end server that I can display throught insomina. Constructing a backend server is helpful for many coders as it is a typical interview project. This project helped me learn more about apis, insomina, and sql. I built this project to test my developer skills. One of the major struggles I had was getting mysql to work with my .env file properly. I think I spent a majority of my time working to get those appilcations up and running. It took a lot of reading and watching YouTube tutorials. I feel accomplished that I finally finished this project after it took me so long.
